# WeatherApp

Created with CodeSandbox
Created a web app using open weather api(https://openweathermap.org/)

1. My Project displayes current weather of several cities having 6 cities in a page, having arranged alphabetically.

2. Below fields are being displayed for each city:
   a) Temperature (current, min, max)
   b) Pressure, humidity, wind speed
   c) Date & Time

3. We have an option to search cities
   a) If search result is empty, displaying the message: "No City Found Matching Your Result"
   b) While making a call to weather api, till the processing, displaying the message "Loading..."
   c) Search is based on universal data, i.e.; it is not limited to default displayed cities.

4. TechStack: HTML5, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript, ReactJS, Material-UI, WebApi
